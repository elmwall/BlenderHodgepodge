# upgraded-broccoli - Early Stage Blender Scripting Projects

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to practicing and testing scripting for creating my own customized Blender functions och processes. I will keep basic concepts and ideas for addons in their early stages here. Projects I find interesting and worthwhile to expand upon I will later move to a dedicated repository.

## Goals

The project serves some personal goals:
- Developing and applying my coding skills in Python
- Getting familiar with Blender API, scripting, and functions overall

There are also driving goals that can benefit myself, but hopefully others as well
- Creating tools for facilitating a better workflow for certain functions in Blender. So far I'm mainly focused on reducing repetitive actions.

## Current Projects

### Geometry Nodes and Shader Nodes Quick Setups

There are those favorite setups and combinations of nodes that one keeps using. The purpose of this addon make some of this combinations easily accessible, and avoid having a repeating ritual of adding these to a node group.

### Lighting sets

The idea for this project is to sets of light which can be added to a scene or around selected objects for renders of certains styles.
